<p>A week ago, I had the opportunity to spend some time in New York City. Thereâ€™s an energy on the streets, as well as a particular aesthetic thatâ€™s hard to replicate anywhere else in the world. As I am a native Kansan, getting to New York is a special opportunity to be able to shoot on the same streets as Garry Winogrand, Robert Frank, Sail Leiter and other legends of the medium.</p>

<p>The week ended too quickly, but I relished the time I had there, and plan on going back to shoot more as soon as I can.</p>
