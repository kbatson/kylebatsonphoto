# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Kyle Batson was born in 1984 and has been practicing street photography 
  for the last decade. Street photography focuses on unposed, candid moments 
  in public places. It is a way to document the the time and and the world 
  that we live in. Kyle uses photography as a way to satisfy his curiosity 
  about the world and to fix in time brief moments of our shared humanity.
