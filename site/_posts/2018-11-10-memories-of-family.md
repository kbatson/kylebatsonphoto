Looking across some old photos led me to ponder on the nature of photographs and why we take them. Despite the artistic endeavor, it has always been for me about memory. Looking through these old photos of four years ago helped me to remember and cherish the memories of experiences the past. I am very grateful I took them.

These photos will never have the significance to another viewer like they do for me, but there are still many similarities with photos I take of strangers. In those fleeting encounters I try to recognize in my subjects a shared experience, and reach out with affection to capture something about who they are as a person. I hope that though they are likely strangers to you, I can capture enough about who they are and their experiences that you can also form a connection with them.
