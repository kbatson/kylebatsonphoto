Visiting the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri is always a great pleasure I attempt to indulge in regularly. While the art itself is always inspirational, I also find the building itself to be a piece of art and get great satisfaction of exploring how the light shapes the intersecting planes of its architecture.

For whatever reason, this visit I found especially inspirational. I wanted to explore every bit of light and shape that exists in its ceilings and walls and floors and find new was to create compositions with this wonderful raw material.

It is the great exercise of a photographer to just learn to see what forms already exist in the world and how to put a frame around them. And I find it invigorating.

All images shot with the Zeiss 55mm f/1.8 FE lens and Sony a7III.
