After a long while, I've finally gotten around to updating the website with new photos. These encompass landscape photography from my travels across the USA, street photography from New York City, as well as a new gallery focused on India. This one needs some editing down, but I took a ton of photos during a recent workshop I attended in November.

Check out the updates to the [New Gallery]({% link gallery-new.md %}) and the all-new [India Gallery]({% link gallery-india.md %}).
