title: About

---
I was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1984 and have been practicing street photography for the last decade. My work focuses on unposed and unplanned moments in public spaces throughout the world, whether in the middle of a bustling metropolis or in the forests of Africa. It is a way for me to document the the time and the world that we live in. I thrive on finding moments of beauty and joy in a chaotic and messy world.

I studied Visual Communication at the University of Kansas and have worked in the software development, marketing, education and design industries.
