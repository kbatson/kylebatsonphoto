<p>Visiting the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri is always a great pleasure I attempt to indulge in regularly. While the art itself is always inspirational, I also find the building itself to be a piece of art and get great satisfaction of exploring how the light shapes the intersecting planes of its architecture.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, this visit I found especially inspirational. I wanted to explore every bit of light and shape that exists in its ceilings and walls and floors and find new was to create compositions with this wonderful raw material.</p>

<p>It is the great exercise of a photographer to just learn to see what forms already exist in the world and how to put a frame around them. And I find it invigorating.</p>
